I am a PhD Candidate at the School of Geography and the Environment, University of Oxford. I am interested to use remote sensing and machine learning methods to tackle food security challenges amidst a changing climate. I have over eight years of experience working in the international development space. I hold a Masters in Public Policy from UC Berkeley, and a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIT Roorkee.
